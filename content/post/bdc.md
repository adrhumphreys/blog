Recently I've been reading a book called [Feeling Good](https://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-New-Mood-Therapy/dp/0380810336) which is about cognitive behaviour therapy, it's one of the books that popularized it. It's really interesting and I'm learning a lot. Some of which I figured I would share on here along with the Burns Depression Checklist which is a tool to measure how depressed you are.

To do it you just have to give each question a ranking based on the previous week (including today).

##### Definitions or Cognitive Distortions
These are the bread and butter of causes for depressive cognition.

__All-or-nothing:__ You see things in black-and-white categories. If your performance falls short of perfect, you see yourself as a total failure

__Over-generalization:__ You see a single negative event as a never-ending pattern of defeat

__Mental filter:__ You pick out a single negative detail and dwell on it exclusively so that your vision of reality becomes darkened, like the drop of ink that colors the entire beaker of water.

__Disqualifying the positive:__ You reject positive experiences by insisting they "don't count" for some reason or other. In this way you can maintain a negative belief that is contradicted by your everyday experiences.

__Jumping to conclusions:__ You make a negative interpretation even though there are no definite facts that convincingly support your conclusion.

1. _Mind reading._ You arbitrarily conclude that someone is reacting negatively to you, and you don't bother to check this out.
2. _The fortune teller error._ You anticipate that things will turn out badly, and you fell convinced that your prediction is an already established fact.

__Magnification (catastrophizing) or minimization:__ You exaggerate the importance of things (such as your goof-up or someone else's achievement), or you inappropriately shrink things until they appear ting (your own desirable qualities or the other fellows imperfections). This is also called the "binocular trick"

__Emotional reasoning:__ You assume that your negative emotions necessarily reflect the way things really are: "I feel it, therefore it must be true."

__Should statements:__ You try to motivate yourself with shoulds and shouldn'ts, as if you had to be whipped and punished before you could be expected to do anything. "Musts" and "oughts" are also offenders. The emotional consequence is guilt. When you direct should statements towards others, you feel anger, frustration, and resentment.

__Labeling and mislabeling:__ This is an extreme form of over-generalization. Instead of describing your error, you attach a negative label to yourself: "I'm a loser". When someone else's behavior rubs you the wrong way, you attach a negative label to him: "He's a goddamn louse". Mislabeling involves describing an event with language that is highly colored and emotionally loaded.

__Personalization:__ You see yourself as the cause of some negative external event which in fact you were not primarily responsible for.
